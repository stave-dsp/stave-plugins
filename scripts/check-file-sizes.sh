# Size is a proxy for mixed concerns; the split decision is human
# (ratified 2026-07-08: the hard caps + shrink-only ratchet became
# signals — the ratchet had forced several genuinely good cohesion
# moves, but a gate that argues about line counts argues about the
# proxy, not the problem). Thresholds: src 1000 lines, tests 1600.
